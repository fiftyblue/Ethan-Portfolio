                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>With over nine and a half years of restaurant industry experience, I intimately understood the challenges faced by staff in high-paced dining environments. While bartending at a farm-to-table restaurant, I observed recurring issues: seasonal menu changes every three months made memorization difficult, staff struggled with accommodating unusual allergies, and the busy environment made it challenging to get quick answers from chefs or managers about menu details.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-study-section">
                        <h3>The Solution</h3>
                        <p>Inspired by a conversation with a friend about LLMs in security threat analysis, I envisioned an AI-powered solution to revolutionize restaurant operations. What began as a simple chat interface experiment evolved into a sophisticated system that transformed how staff accessed and utilized menu information.</p>
                        <p>The development journey started with manual JSON structuring of menu data, which I later automated through fine-tuned prompting. We progressed from basic chat interfaces to API integrations, initially using Apple Shortcuts for OpenAI's Whisper model implementation.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-study-section">
                        <h3>Technical Evolution</h3>
                        <p>The system underwent several iterations of improvement:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented few-shot prompting and model fine-tuning for enhanced accuracy</li>
                            <li>Developed a sophisticated data bucketing system that improved response speed by directing queries to specific data segments</li>
                            <li>Created a web interface with IP-based access control for cost management</li>
                            <li>Integrated WhatsApp functionality for easy staff access and user management</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The final system excelled in three key areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Comprehensive allergy analysis with detailed substitution recommendations</li>
                            <li>Sales-optimized menu descriptions and pairing suggestions</li>
                            <li>Instant access to detailed menu information via WhatsApp</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-study-section">
                        <h3>Impact</h3>
                        <p>The project exceeded expectations, successfully deploying across five restaurant locations. The system became indispensable to staff operations, with usage rates so high we needed to increase our token allocation. Beyond the immediate operational benefits, this project provided invaluable insights into data structuring, API integration, and practical AI implementation in a business setting.</p>

                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>Sony Music executives identified a crucial gap in their marketing strategy: while demographic data was readily available, they needed deeper insights into Gen Z's music consumption behaviors and preferences. The challenge was to move beyond basic metrics and develop a comprehensive understanding that could drive more effective marketing decisions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-study-section">
                        <h3>Strategic Approach</h3>
                        <p>Taking the initiative to address this executive-level concern, I spearheaded a large-scale data collection project leveraging Sony Music University College Collective. As a former member of this network, I recognized its potential to gather meaningful insights from our target demographic.</p>
                        <p>I assembled a team of five student leaders who helped coordinate with 48 Sony college representatives across 31 markets nationwide, spanning from Berkeley to USC. We carefully designed a survey that would capture behavioral patterns while maintaining engagement and providing value to participants.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-study-section">
                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>Our data collection strategy was comprehensive and strategic:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Utilized high-traffic events like football games for survey distribution</li>
                            <li>Integrated with existing Sony events to maximize reach</li>
                            <li>Implemented QR codes for easy access</li>
                            <li>Focused on emotional connections to music consumption</li>
                            <li>Explored music discovery and sharing patterns</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="case-study-section">
                        <h3>Key Findings & Impact</h3>
                        <p>The initiative exceeded our target of 10,000 responses, collecting over 12,000 valuable data points. One of the most fascinating discoveries was about vinyl ownership - we found an almost even split between Gen Z individuals who owned vinyl records with playback capability and those who collected vinyl purely as identity expressions.</p>
                        <p>I presented these findings to Sony executives, including the Senior Vice President of Commercial Partnerships, demonstrating how Gen Z views music as an extension of their identity. This insight has significantly influenced Sony's marketing strategies, particularly in guerrilla marketing approaches targeting Gen Z audiences.</p>
