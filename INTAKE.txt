Our creative content team works closely with our AI engineers and product teams in our Santa Monica office. The environment is highly collaborative - we're constantly brainstorming content ideas, getting real-time feedback on drafts, and working together to translate technical features into engaging social videos. a) This might sound a little unconventional, but one of the best collaborative experiences I’ve had wasn’t in an office, and it wasn’t even for a formal job—it happened right in my kitchen. A friend and I were spitballing ideas over coffee, and it turned into a full-blown project: “StrauntSavant,” a tool for restaurant staff that uses AI to streamline allergy safety and improve service speed. I had all these documents from the restaurant where I bartend, and we started hashing out how to pull it all together into an Apple Shortcut that could make an API call to ChatGPT. What made it special was the spontaneity. We’d hit a snag, bounce ideas around, and keep building on each other’s energy. There’s this unspoken flow that happens in person—you pick up on someone’s thought before they even finish their sentence. Those non-verbal cues, like a quick nod or an “aha” expression, kept the momentum going. By the end of the session, we didn’t just have an idea; we had a solid plan, all thanks to the kind of creative chemistry you only get when you’re sitting across the table from someone. b) For me, the perfect workspace is one where creativity just happens—no forced “let’s all be creative now” energy, ya know? I’m all about open layouts with lots of natural light, where you can overhear someone throwing out a wild idea and feel comfortable jumping in. But at the same time, I like having little pockets of quiet space. Sometimes, you need to pull back, sketch out a messy plan in a notebook, and then come back with something more polished. In terms of working with teammates, I’m big on casual, real-time collaboration. I’d rather walk over and hash things out in five minutes than sit on a thread of emails that could’ve been a quick chat. That said, I value the flexibility to step away when I need to recharge—whether that’s a solo walk or a quick coffee run. It’s all about building a vibe where people feel comfortable being themselves, sharing half-baked ideas, and knowing the team’s got their back. c) Funny thing is, I’ve already made the leap. A couple of months ago, I packed my bags, left Philly behind, and landed in West Hollywood. It’s been a ride, but honestly, I’ve always believed that growth only happens when you’re uncomfortable. Back in Philly, life was familiar, easy—but I kept thinking, Is this it? I wanted more. I wanted to push myself in a way that only a city like LA could. There’s something about throwing yourself into the deep end that forces you to adapt and grow, and I’ve always been someone who seeks out those kinds of jams. d) Since moving, I’ve been soaking up everything the city has to offer. I’ve found my favorite coffee spots, started building out my network, and fully embraced the chaos that comes with living in a place where everyone is chasing something bigger. What excites me most about LA is the energy—you can feel it in every conversation, every late-night brainstorm. It’s a city where people aren’t just dreaming; they’re doing. And that inspires me to do the same, every day. On a personal note, my girlfriend’s been a huge part of making LA feel like home (we met at an AI conference, by the way). She’s shown me the ropes, and together we’ve carved out a little slice of life here that feels equal parts grounding and inspiring. Oh, and Mike—I saw that you’re into triathlons; I should mention I once walked 51 miles around LA in a day just because I had a free Tuesday. It’s a city that dares you to push your limits, and I’m here for it. ---Walk us through your process for creating high-performing social video content from concept to publication: a) My process for developing content starts with a simple but essential question: What’s going to make people stop scrolling and engage? From there, I’m methodical about collecting insights. Whether it’s combing through comments, studying competitor strategies, or just absorbing trends in the wild, I’m always looking for patterns. At SoundMind, when we were exploring mindfulness content, I’d start with a clear problem statement: How do we make mindfulness feel personal and actionable in under 30 seconds? Once I’ve got a few rough ideas, I move fast. I storyboard quick sketches—think bare-bones outlines with captions and visuals—and then I test them internally. Feedback in these early stages is gold because it allows me to refine before taking anything public. But the real validation happens once it’s live. I’m not just looking at vanity metrics like views; I’m digging into retention, comments, and whether people are sharing it. If it sparks a conversation or resonates enough for someone to tag a friend, I know we’re onto something. From there, it’s about doubling down on what works and leaving no stone unturned in the pursuit of that next big hit. b) In fast-paced content creation, my mantra has always been “fail fast”. Social media moves at lightning speed, and the worst thing you can do is sit on an idea for too long. At SoundMind, we had a rhythm: post, analyze, tweak, repeat. We aimed for daily uploads, even if the content wasn’t perfect, because I really believe you can’t get great without first being willing to be bad. It’s all about extracting lessons from the data—every post is a mini case study. For example, when we noticed certain videos weren’t hooking viewers early enough, we pivoted. We made small but impactful changes, like tightening the first three seconds or tweaking our text overlays. Within days, we’d see improvements. I encouraged the team to treat each post like a stepping stone. Mistakes weren’t failures; they were opportunities to gather intel and refine our strategy. This approach kept the content machine running without sacrificing our drive to improve with every iteration. c) Quality and speed might sound like opposites, but I see them as two sides of the same coin. The secret is in building a solid system. At SoundMind, we developed a content framework where each team member had a clear role. I’d handle creative direction and scripting while someone else focused on editing and another on captions and graphics. By breaking the process into manageable chunks, we could crank out videos quickly without compromising on polish. I also believe in having a “quality control” mindset without slowing down momentum. Before anything goes live, I do a quick final check for consistency— brand voice, visual style, captions. It doesn’t take long, but it ensures that even our fastest content feels cohesive and professional. Ultimately, high velocity is only sustainable when everyone knows their role and trusts the system we’ve put in place. d) 
 Data isn’t just a tool—it’s the foundation of everything I do. Every post is an experiment, and I treat the analytics like a report card. I’m looking for specifics: Did the hook land? Are viewers sticking around past the 3-second mark? Which calls-to-action are driving engagement? At Sony, for example, we launched a Gen Z campaign with short-form video ads. Early analytics showed a significant drop-off at the 5-second mark, so I reworked the structure of the next batch, making sure the most impactful visuals and messaging hit in the first three seconds. The result? A 25% increase in average watch time and a noticeable lift in conversions. But optimization doesn’t stop at performance metrics. I also pay close attention to qualitative feedback—comments, DMs, even the sentiment behind the shares. If people are tagging their friends or remixing our content, that tells me we’re not just being seen; we’re starting conversations. That’s the real gold. Once I’ve identified what’s working, I double down. If a particular format or style resonates, I’ll scale it up while keeping a close eye on diminishing returns. It’s a constant loop of analyzing, tweaking, and testing again. My ultimate goal is not just to perform well on one post—it’s to establish a repeatable formula for success that aligns with both brand goals and audience behavior. ---
How would you build SimplyCodes' social presence from 0 to 100K engaged followers in 6 months?  When it comes to building a social presence, the first thing I think about is not just how to get people to follow but how to make them want to stick around. It’s easy to chase big numbers, but if the followers aren’t engaged, those numbers don’t mean much. What I’m really focused on is creating a community—a space where people feel like they’re part of something bigger than just deals and discounts. That’s how you go from 0 to 100K engaged followers. Content that Resonates: The content has to connect on a human level, and that starts by showing people the “why” behind what we do. One thing I’ve seen work really well is behind-the.scenes content. People love seeing how things come together, especially in tech. If we can pull back the curtain on SimplyCodes—showing how the platform works, the thought process behind developing features, or even the real people behind the brand—it makes everything feel more personal. It turns social media into more than just a feed of deals; it becomes a way for people to understand and connect with the brand’s mission. Beyond that, I’d focus on interactive content. Polls, Q&As, and challenges are great, but they’re just the start. Social media should feel like a two-way street, where followers can offer feedback, share ideas, and see those ideas in action. If someone suggests a feature or improvement, we could use social to show how we’re working on it—or even ask for more input as we develop it. That kind of engagement isn’t just valuable; it makes people feel like they’re genuinely part of the process.  Specific example: At Sony, we found that behind-the-scenes videos of artist collaborations consistently performed well. One campaign featured clips of a recording session, and fans loved seeing the creative process. It didn’t just boost engagement; it created this sense of loyalty by making the audience feel like insiders. Video was always my go-to medium for self-expression growing up, so it felt natural to share these experiences. It was never about building a massive brand or gaining a huge following. It was about telling stories that resonated with people and sharing things I found exciting. That authenticity ended up being the key to building an engaged audience. The same principle applies here: peeling back the curtain and letting people in on the process makes them feel like they’re part of the journey, not just spectators. Driving Engagement Beyond Surface Metrics: Here’s the thing: metrics like likes and follows are fine, but they only tell part of the story. I’m more interested in what’s happening beneath the surface. True engagement comes from building relationships. I’d break this into two buckets: quantitative and qualitative. On the numbers side, I’d be looking at things like retention rates (how long people stay on a video), shares, and tags. But just as important are the qualitative signs— comments that show people are connecting, DMs that turn into conversations, or UGC where followers share their own savings stories. If people are tagging their friends or jumping into discussions, that’s when you know they’re not just scrolling —they’re investing their time and energy into the brand. Specific example: When I was a little over a month into managing the social media for an artist I work closely with, we noticed her quantitative metrics were strong— watch time, engagement, and audience reception were all solid. But she was frustrated by a lack of growth in her following and overall viewership. We sat down and talked about what really mattered. She said, “I just want people to listen to my music. I’d rather have 10 die-hard fans than 100 casual listeners.” That shifted our approach. We decided to start with a weekly livestream, where she could perform, chat, and engage with her audience directly. Almost immediately, it clicked. Her following jumped from 8,000 to 20,000 within two months, and more importantly, the engagement felt deeper and more personal. Scaling Without Losing the Human Touch:  As the audience grows, maintaining that personal connection is key. I’d set up systems to keep things running smoothly without losing that authenticity. Tools like Notion for content planning and Sprout Social for analytics would help us stay on track, while automating some of the more repetitive tasks. But the core of this is the team. I’d want a small, focused group—a content creator to handle the visuals, a community manager to foster engagement, and an analyst to keep us informed. Everyone plays a role, and together, we’d make sure the quality stays high even as the volume increases. Specific example: Before I took over as Director of Content at SoundMind, the team was struggling with alignment. Everyone had their own interpretation of the brand’s identity, which led to a lack of cohesion in our content. One of my first priorities was to schedule a series of collaborative in-person meetings. These weren’t about tasks or deliverables—they were about figuring out our “why.” We had deep conversations about our mission, our values, and how we wanted to be perceived. Once we distilled everything into a clear mission statement, I made it a point that every concept or piece of content needed to align with it. The team would take a quick moment before submitting anything to ask, “Does this support our mission?” Within weeks, this shift in mindset brought the entire team into alignment, resulting in more cohesive and impactful content. To Recap: At the end of the day, it’s not just about what we’re posting; it’s about how we’re making people feel. People don’t buy what you do—they buy why you do it. If we can make followers feel like they’re part of the journey, like their input matters and they’re helping shape the future of SimplyCodes, that’s where the real magic happens. Social media becomes a vessel for collaboration, not just promotion. ---
SimplyCodes has a unique advantage: our AI systems and community maintain a real-time database of the best deals across all shopping categories (beauty, fashion, travel, electronics, etc.), verified hourly. This lets us spot and share amazing deals before anyone else.  Concept and hook: The campaign would be called “Simply Decoded,” and the whole idea is to pull back the curtain on what makes SimplyCodes tick. We’d give people an inside look at how our AI and community work together to deliver these insane, real-time deals before anyone else. The hook? It’s not just another boring deals series—it’s an exclusive backstage pass into the world of AI and e-commerce. People are already fascinated by artificial intelligence, so why not let them in on how we’re using it to shake up the game? Making it distinctly different: What makes this different is that it’s not about polished, generic content. It’s raw, behind-the-scenes stuff that feels real. We’d feature quick, fun clips with our engineers breaking down complex AI concepts in simple, relatable ways—like explaining how our deal verification works while comparing it to something totally random, like building IKEA furniture.  Little add-on here: I’m a big fan of using humor and cultural relevance. We could do parodies of trending pop culture moments—think over-dramatized “Dateline” episodes about how we cracked the code on a $500 laptop deal or a fake “Shark Tank” pitch where we propose wild, deal-inspired inventions. These types of pieces keep things light and engaging while showcasing just how far ahead of the competition we are. (I used this once when I made a video about me simply walking to Target to buy pickles, and it got over half a million views… and that was even before I had more than a thousand followers on TikTok, so trust me.) Techniques to maximize reach and engagement: To get this series in front of as many people as possible, we’d tailor each piece for the platform it’s on. On TikTok, it’s all about grabbing attention in the first second or two with bold hooks, jumpcuts, and fast edits. For Instagram, I’d lean into interactive Stories—polls, quizzes, and “Which deal should we decode next?” type of stuff. On YouTube, we’d go deeper with longer episodes breaking down major shopping categories or crazy-good deals. It’s also crucial to remember that no matter how short or long the video is, every piece of content needs to tell a story. Whether it’s a 15-second TikTok or a 5.minute YouTube breakdown, following a three-act structure—setup, conflict, resolution—keeps the audience engaged and ensures the message sticks. At the end of the day, marketing and branding are really just about telling great stories, and it’s important to never lose sight of that. (This is the trick to Instagram stories, too.) Another big piece would be user-generated content. We’d invite followers to submit their own “deal decoding” challenges or questions about how our tech works, then feature their submissions in future episodes. This way, people feel like they’re part of the process, not just passive viewers. And of course, we’d bring in influencers who fit our vibe to help amplify the series and reach new audiences. Measuring success: Success for “Simply Decoded” wouldn’t just be about views and likes, though those are important. I’m more interested in the deeper stuff. Are people tagging their friends? Are they commenting things like “I never knew that!” or asking more questions? Are they sharing their own stories about how SimplyCodes helped them save? On the numbers side, I’d track metrics like retention rates and shares, but the real win is when we start seeing genuine conversations and a growing community of people who feel like they’re in on something special. That’s when you know you’re not just making content—you’re building loyalty. Ideas that didn’t make the cut (aka ideas I came up with after I was about 50% finished writing up this answer, but I still wanted to include them): . The Deal Race: A fun, fast-paced idea where people race to find the best deals using SimplyCodes. Maybe it’s two influencers, maybe it’s audience members—who knows? The focus is on the thrill of the hunt and showing how SimplyCodes gets you to the best deals faster than anyone else. It could even turn into a friendly competition with viewers getting involved. . Battle of the Brands: Take two big brands and put them head-to-head to see who has the better deals. It’s all about leveraging SimplyCodes’ ability to pull up real-time discounts and savings. Could be anything from tech to fashion. This one’s open-ended—plenty of room to adapt depending on what’s trending. . SimplySteal or SimplySkip?: Highlight a deal and let the audience decide if it’s worth it. They vote, we reveal the results, and maybe there’s some back-and-forth in the comments about whether it’s really a steal or something to pass on. Keeps the audience involved and adds that extra layer of interactivity. It could be interesting to deploy this in more of a guerrilla marketing style… I’m going to let these ideas marinate. Three Levels of Shopaholics: AI Edition So here’s the idea: we break this down into three levels—beginner, intermediate, and advanced—and show people how to use AI tools at each stage to save money while shopping online. Now, if you really wanted, you could cram this into a fast-paced 60-second video, giving each level 15-20 seconds. But honestly, it’ll hit way harder if we turn it into a three-part series. Here’s why: people love following along with a series. They’ll see part one, get hooked, and either follow or like the video to make sure they don’t miss the next parts. That’s been a major driver of growth for me in the past, and I think it’d work perfectly here. Level 1: Beginner (ChatGPT) This one’s for the newbies who are just starting to use AI for shopping. You’d show them how to do simple market research—like asking ChatGPT, “What’s a reasonable price range for [product]?” or “What’s a good brand for [category]?” It’s all about helping them get the basics down, so they’re making informed decisions from the start. Super easy, but super helpful. Level 2: Intermediate (Gemini or Bard) Now we’re stepping it up. At this level, you’re using tools like Gemini to compare product specs or reviews. It’s like having your own shopping assistant who gives you the lowdown on what’s worth buying. You could show how to ask, “What are the pros and cons of [product] vs. [product]?” to get a quick breakdown without having to sift through endless reviews yourself. This level is all about saving time and getting to the point faster. Level 3: Advanced (Perplexity) For the pros, it’s all about real-time data. Perplexity is perfect for finding the best deals that are live right now. Let’s say you’re shopping for a new laptop—you can ask Perplexity to find the top deals and even compare prices across sites in real time. The goal here is to show people how they can leverage cutting-edge AI tools to stay ahead of the game and make sure they’re actually getting the best deal, not just falling for marketing gimmicks. Engagement and Structure Here’s where it gets good. At the end of each part, you could say something like, “Alright, that’s Level 1. Ready to level up? Follow for Part 2!” or “I pinned the exact prompt I used in the comments—try it out and let me know how it works for you!” By providing a prompt they can copy and use themselves, you’re adding real value and making it super easy for them to take action. The beauty of this structure is that it’s not just informative, but it also creates a loop where people want to keep coming back. It’s quick, engaging, and most importantly, it builds trust and a sense of community because you’re giving them tools they can use right away. Why do you work? What gets you out of bed in the morning? I work because this idea of potential drives me—both mine and the potential to create something meaningful. I’ve always had this fear of looking back one day and regret not chasing after the things I care about. For me, work is about building, creating, and connecting. It’s about putting in the effort to bring ideas to life, even if they don’t always work out, because that’s where growth happens. I’d rather fail trying than wonder “what if.” I’m also a storyteller at heart. I’ve always seen marketing as more than just pushing products—it’s about giving a brand a voice, a personality that people can connect with. When done right, it turns a transaction into a relationship. What excites me about AI and the tech world is how much potential there is to innovate and tell new stories. The fast pace, the constant evolution—it’s like a playground for creativity. I love figuring out how to take something complex and make it relatable, whether that’s through content, campaigns, or just having conversations with an audience. But it’s not just about what I can do alone. I thrive in collaborative environments where everyone’s working toward the same mission. There’s an energy in that kind of culture—a shared passion that pushes everyone to be better. I love being a part of a team where we can bounce ideas off each other, challenge each other, and grow together. At the same time, I’m constantly looking for ways to improve myself. Whether it’s learning from others, diving into new challenges, or even just absorbing new ideas through books or podcasts, I’m always chasing that next level. At the end of the day, what gets me out of bed is the chance to make an impact. Whether it’s helping build a community, simplifying a complex idea, or just creating something that makes someone’s life a little easier, that’s what drives me. It’s about leaving things better than I found them and knowing that the work I’m doing matters. Share links to your 3 most successful social video pieces.

My friend came to me with a simple ask: she needed a music video for her song “Mexico” within 18 hours, and she had already shot all the footage on a 90s camcorder. When I opened the files, I saw three hours of raw, uncut footage, and I immediately knew this was going to be a sprint. I locked in, went through every clip, and crafted a music video I’m still incredibly proud of. What made this video work wasn’t just the aesthetic—it was how I approached the challenge. Even with limited time, I found ways to keep the visuals dynamic. Thematically, I wanted to make sure the pacing flowed, with each scene complementing the next, despite working with such repetitive footage. And when it was all said and done, I didn’t stop at just the YouTube version. I created vertical cuts for TikTok and Instagram, adjusting each one for platform-specific consumption, whether that meant tighter edits or reimagining sequences to fit shorter formats. If I had more time, I would’ve leaned into my love for preparation. I’m a big believer in “mise en place” for creative work—getting everything laid out and organized before starting. But in this case, the chaos pushed me to adapt quickly, and I think that adaptability speaks to my resilience and ability to execute under pressure. https://www.tiktok.com/@user384263574/video/6985258671630454022? is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7427172623542601258 TikTok- 10.1M views This video is special because it wasn’t flashy—it was just real. It’s me re-gripping a golf club, but the hook was the narration. I was walking the audience through my process, explaining not just what I was doing but why. There’s something almost hypnotic about the simplicity of it, and I think that’s why it resonated. It’s early enough in my content creation journey that you can see the hunger—I’m experimenting, learning, and really pushing to figure out what works. On TikTok, engagement metrics like watch time are king. I optimized this video by keeping it under a minute and layering in fast cuts with multiple angles to keep the visuals fresh. I also used trending audio, even if I muted it, because TikTok’s algorithm prioritizes content that rides those waves. Every little detail was deliberate—down to the captions and tags. I had a direct line to TikTok’s team through a partnership, so I got to experiment with new features like narration, which helped push this video even further. If I could tweak anything, I’d maybe experiment with slightly higher production values without losing that raw, organic feel. It’s a balancing act—too polished, and it stops feeling authentic. But I’d love to see if there’s a sweet spot where I could elevate the quality just a bit while keeping that TikTok magic. https://www.tiktok.com/@user384263574/video/6996700542680468742? is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7427172623542601258 TikTok- 721.9K views This video was an experiment in stripping everything down. No captions, no narration, no music—just raw visuals and sound. At the time, ASMR content was on the rise, and I wanted to see if I could capture that same attention-grabbing quality without relying on any of the usual crutches. It worked. Over 700,000 views later, it proved that simplicity, when done right, can be just as powerful as high-production content. The key here was relentless pacing. Every two or three seconds, the angle shifts, keeping the viewer locked in. I also leveraged a strategic hashtag funnel—starting broad and narrowing to hyper-specific—to maximize reach while targeting the right audience. It was a methodical approach to ensure the video performed well across the board, and it paid off. Looking back, I’d focus on two things: refining the environment and pushing the visual pacing even further. The setting could’ve been more polished, and tighter cuts might’ve encouraged more shares. I think the content’s quality made it interesting, but there’s a difference between interesting and shareable. Next time, I’d add a bit of humor or a quirky element to increase the likelihood of shares without losing the simplicity that made this piece work. Final Thoughts: These three videos showcase not just my ability to create engaging content but also my versatility across different platforms. I know how to lean into each platform’s strengths, optimize for their algorithms, and produce work that resonates with their audiences. Whether it’s adapting quickly under pressure or experimenting with new formats, I bring a creative, data-driven approach that consistently delivers results. Please record a 2-3 minute video introducing yourself and explaining why you're interested in working for Demand.io.
